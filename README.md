### Overview
Created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates the information with Moment.js. Provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Languages/Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Firebase 
- Vue.js for the clock animation. Created by Toshiyuki TAKAHASHI (https://codepen.io/gau/pen/LjQwGp)
- moment.js for calculating time and frequency for each train individually (https://momentjs.com/)
